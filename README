This is a Ruby application I wrote to help Nicola
Smith record metadata about interviews she
conducted as part of her PhD research.

It is based on a very old version of Rails, and
will probably be difficult to get running, but
I'm putting it up here for the purpose of
providing a reference URL for the software.
